            <h2>Crystal Mountain</h2>
            <p>
            Crystal has a wonderful lodge at the summit where you can get great food at a sit-down restaurant. There are two other lodges on the mountain too.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to get to the summit is via a gondola ride that is comfortable and has great views.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've gone to Crystal twice now. There's a wide diversity in runs for every skill level. My favorite run is the Blue at the summit, but I forget what it's called.
            </p>
            <p>There's also places to stay right on the mountain as well as a short drive from the mountain.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Snoqualmie</h2>
            <p>
                If you live near Highland Middle School, Snoqualmie is a great option for skiing because it is so close.
            </p>
            <p>
                I go here all the time. Last winter, I skiied here nearly every weekend.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are multiple places to eat, but my favorite is the BBQ that serves chili and beef brisket. Yum!
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite lift is Silver Fur because it takes you to Hog Wild and the Silver Fur runs which have a lot of jumps.
            </p>
            <p>The runs vary in skill level, but there's not as many runs as Crystal.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Whistler Mountain</h2>
            <p>
                Whistler is the fanciest ski resort I've been to. We stayed at the Fairmon and you could ski right from the hotel to the lift and back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whistler is located near Vancouver, Canada. So you have to have a passport to go there.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a whole alpine village at the base of the mountain with a ton of hotels and restaurants.

    <div class="image-right ski-area">
        <img src="img/mt-hood.jpg" alt="Mount Hood">
        <div>
            <h2>Mount Hood</h2>
            <p>
                This is the only place in the US that has year round skiing. I went skiing with my dad and friend this past summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the summer, you can go skiing, and then paddle boarding in a lake, in the same day! And that's what we did when we went.
